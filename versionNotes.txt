Dependent LCM
* Fixed number of domains (100X number of items by default)
* Use metropolis to move one item at a time to a new domain
* Domain proposal function is a weighted average of 'just filled domains' vs 'any possible domain' based on DOMAIN_RATIO
* Implemented domain_maxitems

In progress
* Allow swapping of items
* Separate out domain_next into different subprocesses
