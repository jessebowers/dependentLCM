Dependent LCM
* Fixed number of domains (100X number of items by default)
* Use metropolis to move one item at a time either transfering it to a new domain or swapping it with another item
* Domain proposal function is a weighted average of 'just filled domains' vs 'any possible domain' based on DOMAIN_PROPOSAL_EMPTY, and decide on swapping based on DOMAIN_PROPOSAL_SWAP
* Implemented domain_maxitems
