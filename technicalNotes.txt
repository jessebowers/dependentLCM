/*
 * OPEN ITEMS:
 * Compilation issues: Figure out why compiling as a package is (MUCH) slower than Rcpp in runtime
 * need to re-introduce swaps
 */

/*
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Allow warmup without archiving, in R allow multiple chains
 * Incorporate optional checks/consistency checks eg domain size, nclasses, etc
 * post-hoc handle label switching
 * Aggregate X so that we can get counts of duplicates all at once rather than one-at-a-time
 * Maybe remove lchoose from cpp. Not currently in use
 * right now we redo counts every time we redo domains. Might be better to save the probability for proposal purposes. Due to class changes this might not represent the likelihood but might be close enough for practical purposes. And might just count for the specific proposal
 * right now when doing domains we do identifiability for every prospective domain. might be better to just do candidate domain

# To compile:
library(devtools)
Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS"="-std=c++11") # CXX_STD = CXX11
devtools::load_all(path="~/dependentLCM", recompile = TRUE, export_all=FALSE)

# To generate documentation (also compiles):
library(roxygen2)
Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS"="-std=c++11") # CXX_STD = CXX11
roxygen2::roxygenize("~/dependentLCM", clean=TRUE)

# To load into library 
# 1) compile
# 2) Remove *.o files as they cause problems
# 3) convert to zip
# 4) Run the following 
invisible(lapply(paste0('package:', names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs)), detach, character.only=TRUE, unload=TRUE)) # detach packages to initialize (or restart R)
remove.packages("dependentLCM") # Remove existing package to initialize
install.packages("~/dependentLCM.zip", repos = NULL, type = "win.binary")
library(dependentLCM)

# troubleshooting
# Remember to remove *.o files as described above
# From Terminal in Rstudio try
# 1) Open Terminal in Rstudio
# 2) cd ... to Navigate to the parent directory of your (unzipped) package
# 3) R CMD build dependentLCM
# 4) R CMD INSTALL dependentLCM
# This provides additional details on why a package failed
