/*
 * OPEN ITEMS:
 * Compilation issues: Figure out why compiling as a package is (MUCH) slower than Rcpp in runtime
 */

/*
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Allow warmup without archiving, in R allow multiple chains
 * Incorporate optional checks/consistency checks eg domain size, nclasses, etc
 * post-hoc handle label switching
 * Aggregate X so that we can get counts of duplicates all at once rather than one-at-a-time
 * Maybe remove lchoose from cpp. Not currently in use
 * Use dropItem for faster counting. Tried this in dropItemSpeedup branch but was not faster in practice. There should be an implementation which is faster. One idea is to change domains from a map of domains to a map of pointers to domains. Then in Bayes.domainCounts have an option just to count the empty domains. You would need to create a new map of just the empty domains then proceed as usual (where updating the new map updates the old).
 * Change how warmup is done. Allow us to input an old DLCM into this DLCM (also allow to just work as is)

# To compile:
library(devtools)
Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS"="-std=c++11") # CXX_STD = CXX11
devtools::load_all(path="~/dependentLCM", recompile = TRUE, export_all=FALSE)

# To generate documentation (also compiles):
library(roxygen2)
Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS"="-std=c++11") # CXX_STD = CXX11
roxygen2::roxygenize("~/dependentLCM", clean=TRUE)
devtools::build_manual("~/dependentLCM") # pdf

# To load into library 
# 1) compile
# 2) Remove *.o files as they cause problems
# 3) convert to zip
# 4) Run the following 
invisible(lapply(paste0('package:', names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs)), detach, character.only=TRUE, unload=TRUE)) # detach packages to initialize (or restart R)
remove.packages("dependentLCM") # Remove existing package to initialize
install.packages("~/dependentLCM.zip", repos = NULL, type = "win.binary")
library(dependentLCM)

# troubleshooting
# Remember to remove *.o files as described above
# From Terminal in Rstudio try
# 1) Open Terminal in Rstudio
# 2) cd ... to Navigate to the parent directory of your (unzipped) package
# 3) R CMD build dependentLCM
# 4) R CMD INSTALL dependentLCM
# This provides additional details on why a package failed
